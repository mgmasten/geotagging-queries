A readme just for this version of things:

The newest version of the project does not use these big datasets, but I want a
record of them. They're too big to push to Github.

So I am keeping a folder called "BigDatasets" on my machine.

allCountries.txt goes in location-data/geonames
all_countries_clean.csv goes in location-data
worldcitiespop.csv goes in world-cities-database
pythonsqlite.db goes in the main directory (geotagging-queries)
